# react-query-essentials

This is the code from doing `React Query Essentials v2` course.

It has some divergencies from the original code, as it used `react-query@2` and I'm using `react-query@3^`.

Commits are references to the course outline.

Course is [here](https://learn.tanstack.com/p/react-query-essentials).
